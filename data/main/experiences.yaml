                    <p>
                      Developed an adaptive connection pool in Python,
                      reducing new connections by 98% and lowering latency by 50%.
                      Critically, leveraged thread timeouts to ensure that the connection
                      pool adapted to load.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Used internal telemetry tools to track connection pool
                      performance metrics (size, number of connections granted);
                      exposed data through a Grafana dashboard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Presented the pool implementation to the entire DevX department, composed of 200+ engineers.
